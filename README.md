# War Cards

This is a Python implementation of the War cards game with a few additional features. The game runs a webapp terminal and is deployed using Heroku and xterm.js for rendering. This project intends to give users feel of the classic take on the (higher or lower based) War card game experience with a few twists.

## Deployment

Hereâ€™s a guide for manually deploying the project to Heroku using a GitHub repository:

### Deployment Steps:

- **1. Create a Heroku Account**
    - Visit [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) and sign up for an account.

- **2. Create a New App**
    - Go to the Heroku dashboard and click **new**.
    - On the dropdown click **Create new app**.
    - Provide a unique app name and select your region then click **Create app**.

- **3. Add Buildpacks**
    - In the **Settings** tab, click **Add buildpack**.
    - Select **Python** and **Node.js** (if needed), ensuring that Python is listed first.

- **4. Connect to GitHub**
    - In the **Deploy** tab, choose **GitHub** as the deployment method.
    - Search for your repository and connect it to Heroku.

- **5. Manual or Automatic Deploy**
    - Enable **Automatic Deploys** for Heroku to update the app with every push to GitHub, or use the **Manual Deploy** option to deploy the main branch manually.

[War Card Game Live Site](https://pp3-warcardgame-a42d2255e474.herokuapp.com/)

- Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
- Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 30 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.
